    <p>"Freedom Goblins" was the fake non-profit organization that youtube content creator 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheGBLN">Goblin</a> used when attempting to bail random people out of jail in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
    <p>His attempts seemed to be somewhat in vain, however <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cduerk/videos">@cduerk</a>seems to have had some alternatively inspirational results applying the same concept</p>
    <p>Bailing random people out of jail may appear to be simply a social media attention getter that is dangerous</p>
    <p>However googling 'corruption of the cash bail system' returns an AI overview that helps put things into perspective:</p>
    <p>Cash bail has corrupted the justice system in several ways, including: 
      Economic injustice
      Cash bail creates a two-tiered system of justice where wealth determines who is released from jail. People who can't afford bail remain incarcerated, while those who can pay are released. 
      Racial disparities
      Black and Latino defendants are often assigned higher bail amounts than white defendants with similar charges. This leads to higher rates of pretrial detention for people of color. 
      Profit-driven industry
      Bail bond companies charge a nonrefundable fee to cover the bail amount for a defendant. This creates a profit-driven industry that extracts money from low-income Americans. 
      Undermines public safety
      Cash bail and pretrial detention can undermine public safety. A study of cash bail in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh found that assigning cash bail increased the likelihood of recidivism by 6-9%. 
      Harms poor individuals
      People who can't afford bail may have to sacrifice paying for necessities like groceries or utilities to pay for bail. 
      Drains resources from families and communities
      Cash bail and pretrial incarceration can drain valuable economic resources from families and communities. 
      Bail reform seeks to address these issues by exploring more equitable approaches to pretrial release and detention. Some jurisdictions have reduced the use of cash bail.</p>
