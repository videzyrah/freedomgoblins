    <h1 style="color:green;">The Tempo Times</h1>

    <p>Google Gemini falsely responds that the tempo of  Metallica's "The Day That Never Comes" is 140 bpm</p>

    <p>In reality it starts at about 59 bpm and eventually gets a tiny bit faster before doubling back beat *density/frequency* to make it essentially 128 bpm proceeding the lyrics "Love is a four letter word" and after repeatedly yelling out 'This I swear' the tempo switches ~twice-ish~ as fast to 264 bpm.</p>
    <p>There is no point in the song that it can be measured as 140 bpm.</p>

    <p>You can search for thoughts about Metallica's "The Day that Never Comes" on Reddit, and the majority of search results will lead you to useless unscientific opinions (i.e. unlike my super awessome tempo analysis)</p>
