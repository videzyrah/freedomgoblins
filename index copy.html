    <p>"Freedom Goblins" was the fake non-profit organization that youtube content creator 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheGBLN">Goblin</a> used when attempting to bail random people out of jail in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.</p>
    <p>His attempts seemed to be somewhat in vain, however <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cduerk/videos">@cduerk</a>seems to have had some alternatively inspirational results applying the same concept</p>
    <p>Bailing random people out of jail may appear to be simply a social media attention getter that is dangerous</p>
    <p>However googling 'corruption of the cash bail system' returns an AI overview that helps put things into perspective:</p>
    <h2>Cash bail has corrupted the justice system in several ways, including:</h2> 
      <li><b>Economic injustice</b></li>
      <p>>Cash bail creates a two-tiered system of justice where wealth determines who is released from jail. People who can't afford bail remain incarcerated, while those who can pay are released.</p> 
      <li><b>Racial disparities</b></li>
      <p>Black and Latino defendants are often assigned higher bail amounts than white defendants with similar charges. This leads to higher rates of pretrial detention for people of color.</p>
      <li><b>Profit Driven Industry</b></li>
      <p>Bail bond companies charge a nonrefundable fee to cover the bail amount for a defendant. This creates a profit-driven industry that extracts money from low-income Americans.</p>
